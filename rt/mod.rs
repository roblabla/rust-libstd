//! Runtime services, including the task scheduler and I/O dispatcher
//!
//! The `rt` module provides the private runtime infrastructure necessary to support core language
//! features like the exchange and local heap, logging, local data and unwinding. It also
//! implements the default task scheduler and task model. Initialization routines are provided for
//! setting up runtime resources in common configurations, including that used by `rustc` when
//! generating executables.
//!
//! It is intended that the features provided by `rt` can be factored in a way such that the core
//! library can be built with different 'profiles' for different use cases, e.g. excluding the task
//! scheduler. A number of runtime features though are critical to the functioning of the language
//! and an implementation must be provided regardless of the execution environment.
//!
//! Of foremost importance is the global exchange heap, in the module `heap`. Very little practical
//! Rust code can be written without access to the global heap. Unlike most of `rt` the global heap
//! is truly a global resource and generally operates independently of the rest of the runtime.
//!
//! All other runtime features are task-local, including the local heap, local storage, logging and
//! the stack unwinder.
//!
//! The relationship between `rt` and the rest of the core library is not entirely clear yet and
//! some modules will be moving into or out of `rt` as development proceeds.
//!
//! Several modules in `core` are clients of `rt`:
//!
//! * `std::task` - The user-facing interface to the Rust task model.
//! * `std::local_data` - The interface to local data.
//! * `std::unstable::lang` - Miscellaneous lang items, some of which rely on `std::rt`.
//! * `std::cleanup` - Local heap destruction.
//! * `std::io` - In the future `std::io` will use an `rt` implementation.
//! * `std::logging`
//! * `std::comm`
